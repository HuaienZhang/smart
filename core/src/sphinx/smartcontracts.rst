Stainless Smart Contracts
=========================

Overview
--------

Stainless now has experimental support for formally verifying smart contracts,
and compiling them to Solidity.

Installation
------------

Development happens on the `smart repository
<https://github.com/epfl-lara/smart>`_, a fork of `Stainless
<https://github.com/epfl-lara/stainless>`_. You can follow the Stainless
`installation guide <installation.rst>`_ and replace stainless with smart as
follows:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git clone https://github.com/epfl-lara/smart.git
  Cloning into 'smart'...
  // ...
  $ cd smart
  $ sbt clean universal:stage
  // takes about 1 minute

You can then create a symbolic link (e.g. for Linux & Mac OS-X) to have access
to a ``stainless`` command-line (assuming ~/bin is in your path).

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ln -s /path/to/smart/frontends/scalac/target/universal/stage/bin/stainless-scalac ~/bin/stainless


Formal Verification of Smart Contracts
--------------------------------------

Let us have a look at `MinimumToken
<https://github.com/epfl-lara/smart/frontends/benchmarks/smartcontracts/valid/MinimumToken>`_
which implements a token with just a ``transferFrom`` function. From the
``smart`` repository, issue the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd frontends/benchmarks/smartcontracts/valid/MinimumToken
  $ stainless *.scala

.. code-block:: scala
  import stainless.smartcontracts._
  import stainless.annotation._
  import stainless.equations._
  import stainless.annotation._
  import stainless.collection._
  import stainless.lang.StaticChecks._
  import stainless.lang.ghost
  import stainless.lang.forall
  import stainless.lang.snapshot
  import stainless.lang.MutableMap
  import scala.language.postfixOps

  import MinimumTokenInvariant._

  trait MinimumToken extends Contract {
    val balanceOf: MutableMap[Address,Uint256]
    var total: Uint256

    @ghost
    var participants: List[Address]

    @ghost
    final def constructor(): Unit = {
      // These requires reflect the default values given by Solidity
      ghost { dynRequire (
        balanceOf == MutableMap.withDefaultValue[Address, Uint256](() => Uint256.ZERO) &&
        total == Uint256.ZERO
      ) }

      ghost {
        participants = List()
      }

      // These asserts are checked by Stainless but not compiled
      assert(distinctAddresses(participants))
      assert(sumBalances(participants, balanceOf) == Uint256.ZERO)
      assert(total == Uint256.ZERO)
      assert(sumBalances(participants, balanceOf) == total)
      assert(forall((a: Address) => participants.contains(a) || balanceOf(a) == Uint256.ZERO))
    }

    @ghost
    final def invariant(): Boolean = {
      distinctAddresses(participants) &&
      sumBalances(participants, balanceOf) == total &&
      forall((a: Address) => nonZeroContained(participants, balanceOf, a))
    }

    @solidityPublic
    final def transferFrom(from: Address, to: Address, amount: Uint256): Unit = {
      // dynamic requirements for input validation at runtime
      dynRequire(to != Address(0))
      dynRequire(from != to)
      dynRequire(amount <= balanceOf(from))

      // these assertions guide Stainless to instantiate the quantifier from
      // the invariant on addresses `from` and `to`
      assert(nonZeroContained(participants, balanceOf, from))
      assert(nonZeroContained(participants, balanceOf, to))

      // ghost code to update the list of participants
      ghost {
        addParticipant(from)
        addParticipant(to)
      }

      // balanceOf mapping before any update
      @ghost val b0 = snapshot(balanceOf)

      // code to remove balance from `from` address
      balanceOf(from) = balanceOf(from) - amount

      // balanceOf mapping before after the first update, before the second update
      @ghost val b1 = snapshot(balanceOf)

      // code to add balance to recipient `to`
      balanceOf(to) = balanceOf(to) + amount

      // proof that the sum of balances stays equal to `total`
      ghost {
        transferProof(b0, b1, balanceOf, from, to, amount, participants, total)
      }
    }

    @ghost
    final def addParticipant(p: Address) = {
      if (!participants.contains(p))
        participants = p :: participants
    }
  }

After 20 seconds or so, Stainless should report that all verification conditions
are valid. What do these correspond to? The file ``MinimumToken.scala`` defines
a token with a ``transferFrom`` function, and maintains an invariant that states
that the sum of balances of participants is always equal to ``total``.

In addition, the invariant states that all addresses that appear in the (ghost)
variable ``participants`` are distinct that all addresses with a non-zero
balance appear in the list of participants.

Thanks to the annotations, Stainless is able to show that, regardless with which
arguments the ``transferFrom`` function is called and as long as the contract
`invariant` holds before the function call, then it will still hold after the
function call.

Showing that this invariant holds after the updates that happens in the
``transferFrom`` function requires some work. Some lemmas that are used to
relate the sum of all balances before and after updates are stated and proven in
the ``MinimumTokenInvariant.scala`` file. In the ``transferFrom`` function, we
then invoke the lemmas using the call to ``transferProof``. These `ghost`
expressions are ignored during compilation.

The ``==:|`` and ``|:`` notations are defined in ``stainless.equations``. They
enable to prove that two expressions are equal by detailing the sequence of
intermediary steps, while providing evidence for each step (or ``trivial`` when
no evidence is required).

``MinimumToken`` is not so useful as is, since there is no way to create tokens.
As an exercise, the reader may try to add a function for minting tokens, and
prove that this function maintains the invariant.

Compilation to Solidity
-----------------------

The ``MinimumToken`` example can be compiled to Solidity using the following
command (still in the ``MinimumToken`` folder):

.. code-block:: bash

  $ stainless --solidity *.scala

This produces Solidity code (in the file `MinimumToken.sol`) containing the
following function, and which can be compiled by the Solidity compiler to
Ethereum Virtual Machine bytecode.

.. code-block:: javascript

    function transferFrom (address from, address to, uint256 amount) public {
        require(!(to == address(0)), "error");
        require(!(from == to), "error");
        require(amount <= balanceOf[from], "error");
        balanceOf[to] = balanceOf[to] + amount;
        balanceOf[from] = balanceOf[from] - amount;
    }

All ghost expressions have been eliminated, and only the dynamic requires
(``dynRequire``) and the code that updates the balances remain.


Features and Usage
------------------


Constructor
^^^^^^^^^^^

The constructor is specified by defining a function in your contract named
``constructor``.


Invariants
^^^^^^^^^^

You can specify invariants on your contracts by declaring a function called
``invariant`` that returns a ``Boolean``. Stainless will then attempt to prove
that all functions marked by ``@solidityPublic`` in your contract respect the
invariant, in the sense that if they are executed in a state where the invariant
holds, they produce a state where the invariant still holds.

When doing any external call, Stainless will check that the invariant at that
place holds, in order to make sure that any reentrancy from the called contract
happens in a state where the invariant holds. For verification purposes,
Stainless will then assume that the state after the external call is completely
arbitrary, except for the fact that it respects the invariant. See the files
`ValidReentrancy
<https://github.com/epfl-lara/smart/frontends/benchmarks/smartcontracts/valid/ValidReentrancy.scala>`_
and `Reentrancy
<https://github.com/epfl-lara/smart/frontends/benchmarks/smartcontracts/failVerification/Reentrancy.scala>`_
for examples that respectively valid and invalid (vulnerable to reentrancy
attacks). If you don't want these checks (for instance because you want to
assume that the interface you're interacting with is non-malicious, you can wrap
the external call with ``ignoreReentrancy``, as shown in the `LoanContract
example
<https://github.com/epfl-lara/smart/frontends/benchmarks/smartcontracts/valid/LoanContract/LoanContract.scala>`_.


Ghost code
^^^^^^^^^^

Ghost code which is annotated with the ``@ghost`` annotation or enclosed in
``ghost { }`` (from ``stainless.lang.ghost``) is ignored when compiling the
smart contracts to Solidity.


Static and Dynamic Checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Importing ``stainless.lang.StaticChecks._`` provides the keywords ``assert`` and
``require`` which trigger the creation of verification conditions. These
expressions are ghost will not be compiled to Solidity, which allows you to
save on gas cost once your contracts are deployed.

On the other hand, importing ``stainless.smartcontracts._`` gives you the
keywords ``dynAssert`` and ``dynRequire`` which do not trigger the creation of
verification conditions, and which *do* get compiled to Solidity (respectively
to ``assert`` and ``require``) to get runtime checks.


Strict Arithmetic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``--strict-arithmetic`` mode (which is enabled by default) makes Stainless
add verification conditions (VCs) that check that arithmetic operations do not
overflow. For instance, when the mode is active, writing ``a + b`` if ``a`` and
``b`` are ``uint256Ì€`` will create a VC stating that ``a + b`` must be greater
or equal to ``a``, and Stainless will report whether this VC is valid or not (or
unknown).


Development
-----------

The `smart repository <https://github.com/epfl-lara/smart>`_ is in active
development and you should expect many (possibly backward-incompatible) changes
as we implement new features. Here is a list of things that we are working on,
or plan to work on in the near future:

* Translation from case classes to struct.
* More uintX types (only uint8 and uint256 are supported for the moment).
* @internal and @external annotations for functions.
* For loops (at the moment, while loops or recursive functions can be used instead).
* Direct compilation to EVM bytecode and other backends.

If you would love to a see a feature which is not listed here, please open an
issue in the `smart repository <https://github.com/epfl-lara/smart>`_.


Known Issues
------------

* For readability, the compiler to Solidity currently prints the names of the
  variables as they appear in your Stainless source code. As such, you should avoid using two variables with the same name in the same scope.


Reporting Issues
----------------

As you start experimenting with your own smart contracts in Stainless, you may
encounter bugs with verification and compilation. These can be reported in the
`smart repository <https://github.com/epfl-lara/smart>`_. You may also
get help in the `gitter channel <https://gitter.im/epfl-lara/smart>`_.
